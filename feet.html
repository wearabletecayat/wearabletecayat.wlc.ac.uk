<p> “We’ve developed a proprietary technology that we have integrated into the midsole of the sneaker that converts audio signals into vibrations,” said Paley. “When these vibrations are delivered through your feet and synchronized with what you hear in your ears, it is a completely transformative experience for digital entertainment. Although initially envisioned to recreate the energy of live music, adding this immersion layer to gaming, movies and VR is the next level.” </p>
